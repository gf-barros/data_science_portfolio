# Data Science Portfolio

Hello, there! 👍😃  <br /> 
This repository contains my ongoing DS projects. The following projects are listed:
* Competitions:
    - Kaggle "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" Challenge 
      - Classification problem using XGBoost with proper feature engineering. 
      - Accuracy: 80.14% (around top 3%) 

* Notes on Data Science:
    - ROC Curve 101. 
        - The ROC curve can be confusing for data science students. 
        - A hands-on project can be a good way of grasping the concepts!
